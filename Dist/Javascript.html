<h1>Javascript</h1>
<p>Welcome to the documentation to Javascript it is here you will find some of the advanced terminology I know<br>
   inside a table and 2 places I've coded Javascript. One thing I'd like to share is that JS isn't my best language.<br>
  didn't get much exposure as I wanted to. However I am working on it.</p>

   <table class="Coding">
    <thead> 
      <tr>
       <th>Term</th>
       <th>Definition</th>
      </tr>
    </thead>
   <tbody> 
      <tr>
       <td> Class</td>
       <td> Template used for many things such as constructors, methods, and the 4 pillars<br>
        of object oriented programming.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
          <td>Method</td>
          <td>Here in javascript methods are different from the traditional C# or Java that I learned about.<br>
             They can still be used in the same ways just has a bit more of a differentiation to it. You have<br>
             methods dedicated to specific things. 
           </td>
         </tr>
         <tr>
          <td>Constructor</td>
          <td>Special type of function called to create an object. It creates objects using arguments<br>
              along with variables that have the proper scope within a class.</td>
         </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>Try Catch block</td>
          <td>Way to dictate error messages as well as print errors if you dislike debugging<br>
           this is an alternative depending on the circumstance is a very useful piece of code.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>Function</td>
          <td>Another way of saying procedure kind of similar to a method in that it lets<br>
              you complete a task. Few tasks that I've done include creating a calender table,<br>
              resizing text, and make a calculator.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>Javascript</td>
          <td>Programming language crucial to many innovations in the world of web development<br>
              one way I've used it is with JSP Java server page. You can code with many languages inside JSP.  
          </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>SQL</td>
          <td>Programming language that can be integrated to Javascript and many other programming<br>
          languages to provide the power of CRUD(Create Read Update Delete) to a database.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>Node.js</td>
          <td>Programming language part of javascript used for database connectivity. Another important thing<br>
            it is used for is a server. Basically it allows you to run javascript on the server. 
          </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>Bootstrap</td>
          <td>CSS framework that offers to Javascript templates optionally.</td>
      </tr>
