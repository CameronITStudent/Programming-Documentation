# Programming-Documentation
This Repository is dedicated to a project I'm creating for employers.
The Purpose of this project is to showcase more about my expertise 
here in the field of software development. Each page is dedicated to a 
certain programming language and what I've learned. 

What that learning entails is some programming terminology as well as some
of the programs I've written putting context into it. These programs can include
anything I've done along my coding journey of hardwork and dedication
Explanations are done within the best of my knowledge.
